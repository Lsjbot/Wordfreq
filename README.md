# Wordfreq
Corpus linguistics tools

Various tools that I have created for corpus analysis. 

Read corpus: This is the main button. It will read a corpus stored as one or more text files in a folder (with subfolders) and extract word counts and n-gram counts. Will write results to files according to checkbox choices. If multiple files, each file is treated as a subcorpus.

Fill database from frequency file: Option to store a reference set of word frequencies in an MS-SQL database, which is then used for keyword analysis.

Analyze n-gram file: Dummy.

Analyse Wordfreq file: Extracts a set of words that are interesting according to some criteria.

K-means clustering: Use the K-means algorithm to find clusters among subcorpora.

Mean shift clustering: Use the mean shift algorithm to find clusters among subcorpora.

PCA: Do principal components analysis between subcorpora.
